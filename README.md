# Yamslam

## Introduction
This is a 2-player dice game that involves strategy. Players take turns to roll 5 dice up to 3 times to get the best combination. There are only 4 chips for each combination, so it's a race to claim a chip before they are gone.

When all 5 dice match, the player has rolled a Yamslam! Thereâ€™s not a chip for that. Instead the player takes any chip and a bonus turn.

The game ends when all the chips have been claimed. When the game ends, it will display both players' scores and allows you to play again.

## Playing the Game
- `Roll Dice`

  - The player can roll the five dice up to three times to achieve one of the eight combinations
  - After the first and second roll, the player can choose the dice they wish to keep and roll the remaining dice again
  - The player can stop rolling the dice at any time if they achieve a satisfactory combination

- `Claim Chip`
  - There are eight possible types of combinations, seven of which have a corresponding chip. There are only four chips of each kind.
    - 2 Pair (Two pairs of dice showing the same face) - 5 points
    - 3 of a Kind (Three dice showing the same face) - 10 points
    - Small Straight (Four dice with consecutive numbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4) - 20 points
    - Flush (All five dice have the same color) - 25 points
    - Full House (3 of a kind and a pair) - 30 points
    - 4 of a Kind (Four dice showing the same face)- 40 points
    - Large Straight (Five dice with consecutive numbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - 50 points
    - Yamslam (Five dice showing the same face) - Take any chip and roll again
  - If any of the three rolls wins a chip, the player may choose to end their turn immediately and collect. If a roll satisfies more than one combination, the player can choose the chip of their choice. The other player then goes.
  - If the dice do not match an available chip, the player does not collect a chip. The other player then goes.
